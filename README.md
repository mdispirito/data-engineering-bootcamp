# data-engineering-bootcamp

This repo contains my own notes and homework from [Zach Wilson](https://github.com/EcZachly)'s June 2025 data engineering bootcamp. I'm taking the course to continue learning, sharpen my skills, and find some inspiration for a cool capstone project!

Check out Zach's [data engineering handbook](https://github.com/DataExpert-io/data-engineer-handbook), a repo with tons of great data engineering learning resources.

Resources for the bootcamp specifically can be found [here](https://github.com/DataExpert-io/data-engineer-handbook/tree/main/bootcamp).

# Environment

The Dockerfile at the root of the repo is just to build a devcontainer environment. Currently I'm using it for week 3's homework to do local PySpark development.
