Types of impact you can have as a data engineer
- measurable
	- improved the efficiency of a pipeline
	- efficiency improvements and experimentation outcomes
- hard to measure
	- quality improvements
		- it's tough to measure (or maybe just not worth the time) when "nothing going wrong" is the ideal outcome
		- number of quality errors is not necessarily indicative of quality, it could mean you're just doing way more quality checks
	- team enablement outcomes
		- for example, a deployment process improvement that saves every engineer on a team 5 minutes every time they deploy
- immeasurable
	- changing the intuitions of leadership by presenting data in a certain way
	- team culture improvements
	- being a "glue" person

How does data engineer's time translate into value
- supplying insights
- preventing bugs and maintaining data trust
- increasing pipeline efficiencies
- enabling other engineers to work faster
- persuading decision makers to use data

When is an insight valuable?
- when it does one of
	- reinforce intuitions
	- contradict intuitions
	- fail to support intuitions (no result is a result)

How to know when your org is overvaluing insights
- (the rate you create insights is a tradeoff with the rate you create tech debt)
- a "crisis" happens
	- you may end up churning out a lot of low quality pipelines or measurements,  because the answer is always needed yesterday
- you start feeling burnt out
- long-term planning disappears
- ad-hoc request hell

How do you push back when insights are overvalued?
- don't be afraid to say no
- leverage your manager for support
- communicate that robust data models are better than one-off pipelines
	- i.e. "going slower will enable us to go faster"

How do you maintain trust in datasets you produce?
- quality checks are important!
- documentation
- good engineering practices
- clear expectations (i.e. documented SLAs, documented gaps)
	- don't be afraid to document limitations
- this type of value is often undervalued because it's harder to measure

How do you increase pipeline efficiencies?
- proper data modelling
- improving on-call processes
- reducing data volumes
- picking the right tool for the job
- simplifying model and reducing capabilities a little bit
	- sometimes analytical partners want every column under the sun "just in case"
