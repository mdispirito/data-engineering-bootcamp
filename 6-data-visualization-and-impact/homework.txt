Exploratory Dashboard:
https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/marco.di.spirito/viz/de_bootcamp_analytics_homework_2/ExploratoryDashboard

Dashboard is interactive and includes the following charts
- Kill metrics (total kills, and kill/death ratio)
- Most Wins
- Most Deaths

It also includes interactive filters on Map Name.
Since there are lots of maps, I recategorized everything outside of the top 7 most popular into "Other".
